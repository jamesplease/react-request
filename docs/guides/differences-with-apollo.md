# Differences with Apollo

React Apollo is a great library, and it served as the primary inspiration for React Request.
There are a few places where this library is different from React Apollo.

### Missing Features

React Request is intended to be relatively lightweight, so it does not implement these
props from React Apollo:

* Polling
* Optimistic responses
* `errorPolicy` prop
* `notifyOnNetworkStatusChange` prop

The general idea behind these omissions is that we believe that implementing these features
within your app shouldn't be much work. If you disagree, open an issue â€“ we may be
wrong!

### Higher-order Component vs Render Props

This library uses a render prop rather than a higher-order component (HoC). As of January 2018,
React Apollo does not implement render prop components, although they are on the roadmap for
a future release.

Render prop components are more powerful than HoCs, so we currently do not intend to release
an HoC. But you can build your own!

Oh, one more thing: once the new React context API is finalized, we will likely adjust this
project's API to more closely align with that API. As of January 2018, it is looking that
will involve switching the render prop from being `render` to `children` instead.

### No queries or mutations

With GraphQL, whether a request is a query or a mutation determines whether the request is made
when the component mounts. React Request looks at the HTTP method instead to determine if the
request is likely a read request or a write request. This determines the value of the `lazy`
prop, which is what determines whether the request is made on mount or not.

### No Data Normalization

React Apollo normalizes your data, and makes it available through the store. This requires a
definition of a "resource" or "entity," which is beyond the scope of this library.

You can build a library on top of React Request that implements a system like that.
